## Problem Statement 

With the upcoming 2020 presidential election and the ever-growing importance of social media to communicate campaign messages, the goal of this repository is to determine whether or not candidate tweets have predictive power on their campaign donations. Specifically, this project focuses on using Natural Language Processing and time-series analysis to evaluate Donald Trump's tweets and to find correlation to whether or not his campaign donations go up or down based upon them. The success of this project is based on whether or not any information on donations can be gained from the analysis. The predictive power of the models will be measured against the naive accuracy of 51.9%.

## Exectutive Summary  

What if istead of looking at the money raised as the sole means to advertise to get votes, we looked at the money raised as an indicator of how many votes you might already have? If candidates started looking at the problem from this perspective, outlets like twitter become even more important. In order to evaluate this, I will be looking at Trump's Twitter feed along side his campaign donations to determine if what he tweets has any impact on how much he raises.  
  
In the year before the 2020 presidential election and with the importance of the outcome for many, candidates are looking for the edge. And as most would suspect the more a candidate spends on thier campaign, the more likely they are to win. "For House seats, more than 90 percent of candidates who spend the most win. From 2000 through 2016, there was only one election cycle where that wasnâ€™t true: 2010."[[1]](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/) This doesn't tell the whole story though. Suprisingly, in "big" elections like presidential general elections the more a candidate spends on advertising actually has little affect on the outcome. [[1]](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/) This is where twitter and social media come into play... The whole point to spending large amounts of money on a campaign is to get the candidates message out. Typically, this takes a large amount of money, but social media has word of mouth free advertisement you can't buy.  

The assumption was made that picking a candidate that tweets the most would provide the largest most complete dataset available for NLP analysis. Thus, Trump was selected for this project. To determine the success of his tweeting in regards to his campaign, both the analysis and modeling will be used to determine whether or not his donations go up as a result of his words.  

In gathering the data for Trump's Twitter account @therealdonaldtrump, the Twitter API was very limited allowing non-paying users to pull only 200 tweets going back only 30 days. Because of this, an archived dataset was downloaded from the [Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive). This dataset included all non-retweeted posts from January 1, 2019 until June 30,2019. Please refer to the original dataset in this repository's datasets folder for complete dataset information. The twitter dataset was then joined with a dataset gathered from [FEC.gov](https://www.fec.gov/data/candidates/president/?election_year=2020&cycle=2020&election_full=true)(Federal Election Commitee).This dataset is a comprehensive set of all donations made to the Trump presidential campaign between Jan. 1, 2019 and June 30,2019. By law all candidates must post quarterly reports of all inidividual donations to their campaign. Thus as of the time of this project, this was he most up-to-date filing available. "The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is the independent regulatory agency charged with administering and enforcing the federal campaign finance law. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House, Senate, Presidency and the Vice Presidency."[[2]](fec.gov/about/mission-and-history/)  

After the data was pre-processed and cleaned, the exploratory data analysis(EDA) was used to determine what if any informaton could be gained for predicting campaign contributions. The EDA process was undertaken as a means for a regression model trying to predict actual campaign contributions given to Trump the following day.  

Trump averaged just under $150k per day during the specified time period and his tweets almost averaged one million likes per day. When you break it down each tweet that he made was favorited on average 100k times. There were two outliers for his campaign contributions. on June 18th and 19th Trump's campaign raised almost $2 million. This bump in donations was due to the fact he officially announced his re-election bid on June 18th.[[3]](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/31/donald-trump-formally-declare-re-election-bid-june-18-florida/1303932001/) Wednesdays had the highest correlation to his donation amounts while Sundays and Mondays had negative correlations. This was confirmed by both a time series analysis and a correlation map.

I used two bag-of-words models to try and find correlations between Trump's tweets and his campaign donations. First, countveoctorizing his tweets did reveal some correlation between conspiracy words such as: rigged, hearings, washed, emails, etc. The
